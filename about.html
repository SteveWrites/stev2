      <h1>Welcome to Mug Life.</h1>
      <p>For the best personalised mugs ever.</p>
      <p>This website provides the best and most adorable coffee mugs in the world. Our website links you to external shops where you can buy the coffee mug of your choice. As we aren’t selling the mugs directly we are able to be impartial about categorizing and rating the mugs on our site.

  A mug will only get listed on our website if it is rated highly by its users (we don’t rely on the shops own advertising!), is easily available (no one off specialist mugs), has a special uniquness or coolness, and lastly if it’s a top selling mug at a prominent online retailer.

You’ve been searching for the absolute best, coolest, funniest or cutest coffee or travel mug in the world? Well that’s where we come in!
